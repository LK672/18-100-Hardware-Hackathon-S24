18-100 (Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering) Hardware Hackathon project completed over the duration of 4 weeks with a team of 4 members. 

Project consisted of using Raspberry Pi Pico and LSM6DS3 accelerometer to accurately track arm movements through discrete analysis of acceleromete and gyroscope data.
Data from the Pico and accelerometer was collected/controlled via a program written in C (via the Arduino IDE)

This data was then transmitted visually using a short python script using the turtle library and serial library.
